## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure derived from requirement clustering -- infrastructure foundation, then core monitoring pipeline, then notification polish and deployment
- [Phase 01]: Used zod v4 with error parameter for clear per-variable validation messages
- [Phase 01]: Node16 module resolution for @octokit/rest v22 conditional exports compatibility
- [Phase 01]: Console.error for config failures (not pino) to ensure synchronous output before process.exit
- [Phase 01]: Deep-copy EMPTY_STATE on initialization/recovery to prevent shared mutable reference
- [Phase 01]: Temp file uses process.pid suffix in same directory as target to avoid EXDEV cross-device rename errors
